# My first website repository

This is a recipe [website](https://devloggith.github.io/odin-recipes/ "DevLoggith's Odin recipes site") project I completed on for The Odin Project. With this project I solidified the HTML skills I've learned so far such as creating an html **boilerplate**, using proper **tags** (like headings, paragraph, anchor, image), how to use **absolute** and **relative** href attributes, and proper **best practices** for accessibility. (Not to mention learning how to properly use Git and Github in the porcess as well).

Thanks for taking a look!
