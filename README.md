<h1>My first website repository</h1>

This is a recipe <a href="https://devloggith.github.io/odin-recipes/">website</a> project I completed on for The Odin Project. With this project I solidified the HTML skills I've learned so far such as creating an html <strong>boilerplate</strong>, using proper <strong>tags</strong> (like headings, paragraph, anchor, image), how to use <strong>absolute</strong> and <strong>relative</strong> href attributes, and proper <strong>best practices</strong> for accessibility. (Not to mention learning how to properly use Git and Github in the porcess as well).

Thanks for taking a look!
