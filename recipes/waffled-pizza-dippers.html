    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat waffle maker with 8-inch-square cooking surface on Medium-High heat 
          setting.</li>
        <li>In medium bowl, mix both cheeses, basil and oregano; set aside.</li>
        <li>In 1 1/2-quart saucepan, heat pizza sauce over low heat, stirring 
          occasionally, until hot. Place in small serving bowl.</li>
        <li>Unroll both cans of dough onto work surface. Separate each crosswise,
