    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A perfect fall desert ready to be taken to Thanksgiving dinner! Flakey
        dough is loaded with apples, caramel and cinnamon then topped with butter 
        and brown sugar.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>12 frozen white dinner rolls (uncooked)</li>
        <li>2 medium apples (I used gala)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>30 vanilla caramels, unwrapped and divided</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter (melted)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp heavy cream</li>
        <li>Flour (for dusting)</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Place dinner rolls on a microwave safe plate and microwave on defrost
          for about 2 minutes (or until dough is no longer frozen, but not
          cooked).</li>
        <li>Butter a small casserole dish (approximately 9"x6") and set aside.</li>
        <li>Peel, core and dice apples. Place them in a medium size bowl. Add sugar
          and cinnamon. Toss to coat. Set aside. Unwrap and cut 18 caramels into
          quarters. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Lightly flour your countertop.</li>
        <li>Toss 1 piece of dough in flour and flatten and stretch like you are
          making a mini pizza. Stretch dough to about 3” across.</li>
        <li>Reserve ¼ cup apple mixture. Add a tablespoon of apple and 6 of the cut
          caramel pieces. Pull the edges of the dough together to create a ball.
          If they ball won’t seal, tap your finger tips into the flour and crimp
          the seal together.</li>
        <li>Place dough ball in prepared dish. Repeat until all apple pies are in
          dish. Brush apple pies with melted butter (use it all). Sprinkle with
          reserved apple mixture and brown sugar.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 minutes until the tops are golden brown and the pies are
          no longer doughy.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place 12 remaining unwrapped caramels and cream in a
          microwave safe bowl and heat until melted. Stop microwave and stir every
          30 seconds. Once you have a smooth mixture, set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and drizzle with caramel sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
